## Minecraft Scanners List

A ip list to specifically block minecraft scanners.

### Why block these?
* Performance, mass pings can cause a DoS effect.  Additionally modded servers may suffer misc performance issues from frequent pings.
* Annoyance, these pings clutter up the server logs, analytics, and are just rather annoying.
* Security, while security through obscurity is no security.  It does help reduce the amount of garbage pointed in your direction.

### Criterias to be listed?
* No AWS/Oracle
* No dynamic/residential IPs - No point in adding these as they will change to frequently.
* No tor/proxies - Can easily be covered by a generic tor/proxy blacklist


### ASN Offenders:
* PFCloud - They are by far the worst offenders of allowing this activity
